Project Overview
Clean Air Healthcare is a lung cancer prediction platform that allows users to assess their lung cancer risk via a machine learning model. Admins have complete visibility and control over users, predictions, and static content.

User Flow
Sign In / Register

If the user doesnâ€™t have an account, click "Don't have account?" to register.

During registration, the user must enter a valid email and verify it using OTP sent via email.

Once verified, the user can log in.

Cancer Prediction

After login, click the "Try Prediction" button.

A prediction form opens with lung health-related questions.

Submit answers to receive the prediction result.

Users can make multiple predictions.

Users can view previous predictions in their dashboard.

Logout

Once done, click logout to exit securely.

Admin Flow
Admin Login

Admin credentials are predefined:

Username: Admin

Password: 12345

Role-based verification ensures only admin can access the admin dashboard.

Admin Dashboard Features

Update website content including images, healthcare center suggestions, and doctor suggestions (static/dynamic).

View all registered users and their prediction results (fetched dynamically from MongoDB).

Full access to content management.
